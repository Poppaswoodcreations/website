Heirloom Quality: The Sustainable Choice for Eco-Friendly Play
The foundation of a great wooden toy is the wood itself. Poppa's Wooden Creations uses a premium selection of New Zealand native timbers that are durable, beautiful, and distinct.

Materials That Last for Generations:
Kauri: Revered for its rich, warm tones and historical significance, Kauri creates beautiful and highly valuable heirloom pieces.
Rimu: Known for its striking grain patterns, Rimu offers both beauty and exceptional durability for toys like the popular wooden train sets and cars.
Macrocarpa: A popular timber for its resilience and pleasant aroma.
Note: While premium native timbers are a focus, some items also use durable pine to offer more accessible price points to buyers.
Commitment to Child-Safe Finishes:
For parents looking for sustainable toys, the finish is just as important as the wood. All pieces are hand-sanded to a silky-smooth finish and coated exclusively with child-safe, non-toxic materials. This ensures the toys are safe for little hands (and mouths!) while remaining genuinely eco-friendly toys Whangārei can be proud of.
